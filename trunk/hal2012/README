FreeHAL 2009 is a reimplementation of FreeHAL, which was developed 
from 2006 to 2008. It aims to /just work/, without requiring the user to
know how FreeHAL works internally.

To compile and install FreeHAL, you need:

    * cmake
    * perl 5
    * and optionally parrot with rakudo perl (an implementation of perl 6)

To compile the command line version of FreeHAL, invoke:

    $ cmake .
    $ make hal2012

Then, execute FreeHAL 2009 by running:

    $ ./hal2012 -i "A german sentence you want to say to FreeHAL"

or:

    $ ./hal2012 -s # This starts a shell where you can type in sentences

English will be the next language which is going to be ported from the old
FreeHAL to FreeHAL 2009.
